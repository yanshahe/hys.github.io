            <p>The dataset I used is “17k Mobile Strategy Games” from Tristan at Kaggle. It is an enriching dataset about 17007 strategy games on the Apple App Store collected in 2019. The 17007 observations and 18 variables contain both essential information about the game itself – such as the name, the developer, and the descriptions– and the data from the players side including the average ratings and the number of ratings. Since 17007 is such a sufficient quantity, I would like to use this dataset to gain insights about the trend of the mobile strategy game industry and explore its marketing messages. Therefore, I would divide my project into two parts: the data visualization of the basic information of the 17007 strategy games; and a deeper text analysis for the descriptions of top popular games.</p>

                <p>By sorting the popularity scores, I extracted the top ten popular mobile strategy games in this dataset and randomly chose three reviews on the Apple App Store for each of them. I would like to compare the sentence length, top lemmas, the pos table, word cloud, and distinctive words for the descriptions and reviews.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Sentence Length</summary>
                    <p>For both the descriptions and reviews, the most frequent sentence lengths were between 10 to 25 words and the most frequent pos tags were noun and verb.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Pos Table</summary>
                    <p>One interesting finding was that for the descriptions, pronouns took up  5% of the pos table and proper nouns took up 11%, while for the reviews, pronouns took up 13% and proper nouns took up 1%. The difference between pronouns might illustrate the formal tone by the game developer and the causal tone by players, and the difference between proper nouns suggested that the in-game proper nouns officially highlighted by the developer were not quoted by the players in the reviews.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Top Lemmas</summary>
                    <p>As for the top ten lemmas, “money” and “time” were in the list both for descriptions and reviews, which was interesting since the two words corresponded to the main elements that were usually considered by mobile strategy game developers: the time consuming and the easiness of gaining in-game money/coins. It might illustrate the trend of developing mobile strategy games with more casual elements – As Wilhelm Voutilainen wrote in his article “5 mobile game feature trends to keep an eye on, ” there was the demand for “extremely simple, quick and repeatable games” in the mobile game market – Actually, a relatively new genre of strategy games growed fast in recent years, one of the successful example was the idle strategy game AFK Arena, with more than one million daily active users, according to Andrea Knezovic’s <span><a href="https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/afk-arena-analysis">“AFK Arena Analysis: The Road to More Than 1 Million Daily Active Users”</a></span>.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Distinctive Words</summary>
                    <p>When comparing the word clouds and distinctive words (via tf-idf) for descriptions and reviews, it was obvious that developers tended to put marketing messages in the description parts, with call-to-action words such as “subscriptions” and official events links while the players seemingly tended to share their game experience, emotional feelings, and encountered problems with other players.</p>

        <div class="container analysis">
            <p>As mentioned before, the project needs more data, especially the descriptions and reviews, to develop more convincing learnings that can be utilized in the industry. In general, the mobile strategy games industry is blooming and competitive. In a detailed perspective, it is seemingly an obvious gap between what the developers would like to introduce and how players would like to see the game – so far we have not seen a stable connection between the  descriptions and reviews. A two-way symmetric communication can be improved between developers and players if developing more research on the players’ demand and what they really want to gain information about the games on the Apple App Store. This does not mean that developers should not publish official announcements or marketing messages on the descriptions, but advising a more flexible way to utilize the descriptions section for more effective message delivery to the core players. After all, it is the strategic communication with the players of the game that will help extend the product life cycle. </p>
